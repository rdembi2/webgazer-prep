# TODOs 

* Get expand to work.

* Have Next, Prev switch between apollo and sunset videos

* Make this look a little nicer 

* Pick a better video

* Find prior lit

* Set up presentations

* Get one round of feedback from Angrave at least

## Nice to have

* Instead of hover we can have a timer that gets reset after some time.

* See if we can make a `webgazer` hover thing on the other file so we can brag we have two things

* React?? Too much effort proly 

## Future Work

* ClassTranscribe Integration

* Cross OS (since C# will only work on Windows tbh), at least it's free

* https://github.com/szydej/GazeFlowAPI can give raw access to coordinates that we can work with
